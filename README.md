# QOSF-Mentorship-Screening-Tasks-
trainned a variational circuit to give a 4-qubit output  state from a random 4-qubit input state. I completed this task using Qiskitâ€™s Circuit Library to create and  test the variational circuit as a quantum neural network. Through executing the job on a QASM  Simulator, it allowed me to get results that should be expected on NISQ devices.
